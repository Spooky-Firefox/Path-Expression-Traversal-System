# Path-Expression-Traversal-System

![The logo, depicting a cat slowly becoming a mesh network](./readme_images/PETS.png)

PETS, a system to store linked distributed data with traversal functions

## Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant API
    participant cent as Central server

    note over API: where request start


    note over cent: A server which listens to http request<br/>and answer/forward queries.<br/>All servers are of this type, but their<br/>databases very<br/>and the central database is quite<br/>different with only one node*.

    API->>+cent: Pick/crafted_by*
    note left of cent: sent over http api

    loop until not stored
        create participant DB_A as DB
        cent->>DB_A: 
        note over DB_A: This database is just a node<br/>which edges point to items in other servers
        destroy DB_A
        DB_A->>cent: 
    end
    note left of DB_A: won't loop since only one node



    participant Tool_company as The tool company
    cent->>+Tool_company: Pick/crafted_by*


    loop until not stored
        create participant DB_B as DB
        Tool_company->> DB_B: 
        note over DB_B: A graph data base<br/>keeps track of nodes<br/>and relations between them.<br/>Also have node to denote<br/>when to pass the query to<br/>different server.
        destroy DB_B
        DB_B->>Tool_company: 
    end

    note left of DB_B: Pickaxe don't have<br/>nodes stone or stick<br/>returns server contact<br/>information.

    
    note right of Tool_company: outgoing querys can be sent in parallel
    participant Mason_LTD as Masons LTD
    Tool_company->>+Mason_LTD: Stone/crafted_by*


    loop until not stored
        create participant DB_C as DB
        Mason_LTD->>DB_C: 
        destroy DB_C 
        DB_C->>Mason_LTD: 
    end
    note left of DB_C: Stone don't have crafted by<br/>and is att end of query, return stone


    Mason_LTD->>-Tool_company: Data of Stone

    participant Wood_INC as Wood INC

    Tool_company->>+Wood_INC: Stick/crafted_by*
    loop until not stored
        create participant DB_D as DB
        Wood_INC->>DB_D: 
        destroy DB_D
        DB_D->>Wood_INC: 
    end
    note left of DB_D: This query can be resolved<br/>without traversing to other<br/>servers<br/>Stick -> Plank -> Log

    Wood_INC->>-Tool_company: Data of Log
    Tool_company->>-cent: [Data of Stone, Data of Log]
    cent->>-API: [Data of Stone, Data of Log]

```

## Query structure

The query structure was designed for simplicity and not fines, the goal was an easy way to write path expressions with loops

```mermaid
graph LR;
    S -->|Pick| Pick;
    Pick -->|made_of| PickRecipe;
    PickRecipe -->|crafting_recipe| Stick;
    Stick -->|made_of| StickRecipe;
    StickRecipe -->|crafting_recipe| Plank;
```

### Example 1, Simple treversal

S/Pick/{Made_of/crafting_recipe}

Will take traverse from the start server containing the Pick to a what it is made of to what that things crafting recipe

### Example 2, Loop

S/Pick/{Made_of}*

Will see what pick is made of recursivly down to its minimal component

### Example 3, Or

S/Pick/{Made_of | Crafting_recipie}

Will return either what it was made of or its crafting recipie

### Example 4, AND

S/Pick/{Made_of & Crafting_recipie}

Will return both what it is made of and its crafting recipie

### Example 5, ()

S/Pick/{(made_of & Crafting_recipie)/made_of}
